        <p><strong>Lasagna</strong> (<em>US: /ləˈzɑːnjə/, UK: /ləˈzænjə/, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]; singular lasagna, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]</em>) 
            are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, [1] made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian 
            dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses 
            (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. 
            [2] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients 
            and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>½ (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups dried malfada noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat 
                until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until 
                tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
