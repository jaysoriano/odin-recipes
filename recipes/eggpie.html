                <h1>Egg Pie</h1>
                <p>An <strong>egg custard pie</strong> is any type of uncooked custard mixture added to an uncooked or partially cooked crust and baked together.[1] 
                    In North America, custard pie commonly refers to a plain mixture of milk, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla extract and sometimes 
                    nutmeg combined with a pie crust. It is distinctly different from a cream pie, which contains cooked custard poured into a cooled, 
                    precooked crust.[citation needed] In the United Kingdom, the comical or political act of pieing is conventionally done with a "custard pie". 
                    Some common custard pies include pumpkin pie, lemon and buttermilk chess pie, coconut cream pie, and buko pie. True custard is defined as a 
                    liquid thickened with eggs. Due to the often large number of whole eggs in custard pie it is a very rich pie.</p>
